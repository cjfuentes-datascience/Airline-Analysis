# Airline-Analysis

In this project, we’ll imagine that we work for a travel agency and need to know the ins and outs of airline prices for our clients. We want to make sure that We can find the best deal for our client and help them to understand how airline prices change based on different factors.

We decide to look into our favorite airline. The data include:

1. miles: miles traveled through the flight
2. passengers: number of passengers on the flight
3. delay: take-off delay in minutes
4. inflight_meal: is there a meal included in the flight?
5. inflight_entertainment: are there free entertainment systems for each seat?
6. inflight_wifi: is there complimentary wifi on the flight?
7. day_of_week: day of the week of the flight
8. weekend: did this flight take place on a weekend
9. coach_price: the average price paid for a coach ticket
10. firstclass_price: the average price paid for first-class seats
11. hours: how many hours the flight took
12. redeye: was this flight a redeye (overnight)?


In this project, we’ll explore a dataset for the first time and get to know each of these features. Keep in mind that there’s no one right way to address each of these questions. The goal is simply to explore and get to know the data using whatever methods come to mind.
